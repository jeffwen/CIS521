  As I promised, I would give you the name of the Panther's president. After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers.  A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_ Torrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as persident and general manager of the New York Islanders. Throughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torrey's bow ties have become as much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair.  The Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price information in early next month. In the meantime, Huizenga leaves the day-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP and GM.  The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team to focus attention on an endangered species. There are 30 to 50 Florida Panthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.  "The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats," Torrey said. "Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice."  More BIO: In Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four consecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons. As executive vice president of the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play- offs in 1968, only their second NHL season.  "I guess this completes my own personal hat trick", said Torrey, 58, a native of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm Beach.

Any other  The Leafs have always been kind of comical. During the second Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a "cancer on the team", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.  Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised the Philly captaincy by new GM (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke. Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him. Then he was traded to Chicago.  During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an attempt to kiss the ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman. Leeman wouldn't take it and when they tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators. While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy. Bridgman be- came the new captain. A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain since Clarke was still the undisputed leader amongst the players. The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.   --  cordially, as always, maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca "So many morons... rm ...and so little time."

  Aargh!  Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the NHL. He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques. The Nords' penalty came in O.T. Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself, was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!  It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous goalkeeping. The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau was serving a penalty. I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the last 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT. The Nords were caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once. Stewart turned the other cheek...BASTARD!  Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and on his knees for the rest of the night. The winning goal shouldn't have gone in.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming the loss on Stewart. The Habs had plenty of chances to capitalize, Muller, LeClair, Haller, etc. but failed to put the puck in the net. That's what did them in. But Mr. Stewart didn't help matters at all.

Jagr did not have a better season than Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of hockey knowledge. Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.  Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice time per game and some measure of its "quality" (i.e., is the player put out in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or >were the Stars really not making a profit? Or was the city or whoever >owned the arena doing some price gouging?   Norman Green claims that he has lost money over the last three years that he has owned the team. When he bought the team, it seemed kind of obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red, before the team started making a profit again. He gave the impression that he was willing to do so. He claimed two years ago that the team needed to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit, but this season the team averaged 12000+ fans, despite increasd ticket prices. I think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward trend, which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in deciding to move. He was even offered the many concessions he rudely demanded, such as guaranteed season ticket sales, cheap rent at the other two arenas in town, etc.  Oh well, I guess the bottom line is $$$. Green wanted immediate huge returns in Dallas, and wasn't willing to wait another year or so in MN. Dallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although I feel Minnesota's was quite reasonable), and he also has some cronies down there as well. All this means, is that Minnesota is without an NHL team for a year or two. Too bad for the NHL.  KEA

  In the mist of the Rangers soap box (i.e. Captain neMesis-ier/ex-coach Roger Nebula bad blood bath) and with high hopes turned to new coach Mr. Klean (Commissar Keenan)... I would like to know what procedures hockey teams use to select their captains (including A's). Are they selected by the coaching staff, do the players vote for a captain, or are they appointed by management?  And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded, resigned, or been striped of his title during the season? Any other team captain trivia would be appreciated.  -- Mike
  Detroit is a very disciplined team. There's a lot of Europeans in Detroit which would make the game fast, so Toronto would have to slow the game down, which means drawing penalties, as a last resort anyway. Toronto will be a good team as soon as they get more good players. Toronto is just an average team, Detroit isn't Ballard screwed Toronto when he was owner. Everyone knows that. and it's going to take time for Toronto to become a real force. I expect Gilmour to be burnt out next year. He can't pull the whole team forever.

John Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his All-Madden team a lot, over much better receivers...for much the same reasons Cherry sings the praises of Doug Gilmour...a little guy with heart...yet one doesn't see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has lost his marbles.

The contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the same team or different teams.

The operative words are "in part" - stats must be interpreted, tempered with other information one has about the player.   > To compare Jagr's and Francis's plus/minus is ridiculous and absurd...

  Has anyone heard what game ESPN is showing tonight. They said they will show whatever game means the most playoff-wise. I would assume this would be the Blues-Tampa game or the Minnesota-Red Wings game... Anyone heard for sure???   Jeff Swartz
  You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan. Anybody who plays the way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players. Bobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players like Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000 aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day. The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a Stanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not even notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey.   Rich

Pocklington has chosen this moment to make his "last" stand is because he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial government is months away from a provincial election...it is the moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price... and it is before the NHL's new collective agreement with the players which might involve some enhanced revenue-sharing.  Pocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them.  He can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his price if Edmonton doesn't.  Edmonton has already fucked up its international airport, and surrendered supremacy to Calgary, and over the next few years Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks. It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find a way to lose its hockey team too...because Northlands wants to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing.  However, in this case, about the long-term financial viability of the Oilers, the fact is that Pocklington is basically right, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right to provoke the crisis now, before the team accumulates millions of dollars in losses, or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack of money.  Sather has done his job...the Oilers are poised to be competitive again very soon (Al Strachan, one of the most knowledgeble hockey writers in Canada in a post-mortem of the Oilers season in the Globe and Mail recently agrees with me.)

No, Caleb, it's not the quality of ESPN that I have a problem with; it is superb, whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where ESPN left off when hockey went to SC (this is excepting SC's use of feeds from CBC (-;). It's the amount of hockey they're showing, or lack of it, that we're complaining about. They had rights to two OT's that could've been shown on Sunday night after baseball ... and they had pickup trucks racing through oversized pigpens followed by Super-8 home movies of old car races (yes, I was checking in desperation for Canucks-Jets) last night after SportsCenter.  gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

Pros arrive late, nervousness for rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things hard to get it going against these "worse" nations. I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.  Some other reasons why the "worse" teams are so tough to beat was presented by Hans "Virus" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).  1) The "worse" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc) have now usually world class goalies.  2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much less unnecessary penalties.  3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them "run out of gas."  4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.  > The only convincing winner was...

I remember reading an article in Reader's digest many moons ago about a similar incident. During a minor leaque game a player neck was cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes flew up. In this case the victim's mask proved a hinderance since his face was protected and so he didn't bother with the usually instinctive reaction to protect his face/neck. A quick thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using snow to contract the blood vessels (from what I can remember).

   And now, I interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you another message sponsored by the Department of Really Mundane Statistics:  I passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through a filter to average out games, goals, assists, points, and penalty minutes for the mythical average NHL pro who played in the league this season. (Why? Because it's Monday and I didn't feel like writing any REAL code...)  Anyway, after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list, I came up with:  NHL average: 55 GP 11 G 19 A 30 Pts 69 PIM  Then I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.  Marty McInnis (NYI) 56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%) Igor Kravchuk (EDM) 55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%)  These two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far off in PIM. This leaves, as the most average player in the NHL:  Bobby Carpenter (WAS) 65 GP (18%) 11 G (0%) 17 A (10%) 28 Pts (6%) 63 PIM (8%)  What an honor.  I also passed the list through with the goalies still included. Kravchuk and Carpenter were still in the top three, but Rob DiMaio came flying up from behind to take the title:  NHL average: 53 GP 10 G 17 A 27 Pts 64 PIM Igor Kravchuk (EDM) 55 GP (3%) 10 G (0%) 17 A (0%) 27 Pts (0%) 27 PIM (50%) Bobby Carpenter (WAS) 65 GP (22%) 11 G (10%) 17 A (0%) 28 Pts (3%) 63 PIM (1%) Rob DiMaio (TB) 54 GP (1%) 9 G (9%) 15 A (11%) 24 Pts (11%) 62 PIM (3%)   It's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it.  -SG  And now, back to our regularly scheduled programming...

It's boredom, and it's being spoiled. The Arena's been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just take winning for granted. It's been seemingly forever since the team lost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and surprise at victory.

  "They're real and they're spectacular", the Blues shutout the Blackhawks in consecutive playoff games.  If the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday, I will launch a broom onto the ice in the last seconds of the game. "Not that there's anything wrong with that."  Curtis Joseph has been the "master of his own domain", and the Hawks have been shooting the puck like a bunch of "chuckers". Not even "Superman" could play any better in goal. Joseph must have been eating his "cereal."  "It's like a sauna in here" said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and the wild crowd at the Arena.  It was "very refreshing" to see the Blues "double-dip" the Hawks.  The Hawks goons tried to "pick" on Hull, Janney, and Joseph but the Blues checking line "nipped" those Hawks real well.  The fat "Yoyoma" will sing on Sunday, and the Hawks will head to the "beach". The Hawks' trip back to Chicago will feel like a long "journey from Milan to Minsk"  Enjoy Sunday's game with some Junior Mints and wash them down with a Snapple.

   Here we are with the Sabres up 2-0 to the Bruins and the Sabres' farm team, the Rochester Amerks, on their way to the Calder Cup (urp!) and what kind of hockey coverage are we getting? The same Penguins/Devils every other day crap that everyone else gets. What's worse, the SportsChannel coverage of the Islanders appears to be blocked out, since we got CBA basketball last night, if you can believe it.

  Did anyone see the Montreal - Quebec game yesterday? It was tight right down to the last second of the third period. In the overtime Roy and Hextall played like they were gods. Ok, so Montreal won! They deserved it after getting their first goal in overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick. Their second goal in overtime was also replayed, but I could not tell if it was the Montreal player who kicked it in. The puck definitely was not directed in by a stick. Anyways, Montreal is back into the series.        Dave Vergolini Michigan State University vergolin@euler.lbs.msu.edu

I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty good centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt, however, keeping Esposito would have made a difference in those series, as he did not for the Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston, for that matter).

I'm from Canada and I know that cbc and tsn have games on every night, all you have to do is go to a bar with a satellite. I have watched both games between Mon Que and toronto and detroit, not to mention Van vs Winn and with cbc. They show all goals from every game that evening so I haven't missed a goal all playoffs.

  Do the Isles have another defenseman to insert into the line-up besides Pilon??? Once again, last night's STUPID penalty put the Isles in a hole for the remainder of regulation and 2 minutes into overtime!!! Even though the Isles nearly survived Pilon's blunder in regulation, it was the most inopportune time for a 5-minute major penalty. Instead of confronting Cote as he came across the blueline, Pilon backed up and swiped at Cote's nose with his stick. Al Arbour can't be serious to think Pilon is the guy to have out there with the game on the line??? I heard Scott LaChance is out till later in the series, but there must be someone else!!! Bring back the BAMMER, Dave Langevin!!!!  *******************************LETS GO ISLANDERS********************************  John Scialdone SCIALDONE@NSSDCA.GSFC.NASA.GOV  """I've been gambling hereabouts, for 10 good solid years""" JG/RH

I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract. Risebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks. Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes.  I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract. He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help a team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers, and Makarov doesn't show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will just bite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him. With his current attitude, he is a detriment to the team.  Alan

It probably depends on your cable company.  I started off switching between the CBC and ABC broadcasts, but finally settled on ABC. I can't stand Don Whitman, and Al Michaels was doing a decent job. He followed the play pretty well, knew all the players' names, and only made a couple of "rookie" mistakes that I noticed. One thing that surprised me is that they never once attempted to explain the offside rule.  Am-I-paranoid-or-is-this-really-happening department: There were no fights in the game, but there were a couple of occasions where it looked like a fight was about to start. Both times ABC cut away to show a closeup of a coach or McNall or something. Has ABC decided to adopt the "Spicer policy?"  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lorne Epp epp@mala.bc.ca

Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.  > However, it's been proved that both fan groups can cheer the same team > - that's "the Finnish national team".

After a > couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the > Nordic (presuming that our teams would have the advantage in drafting > local talent, as prooposed).  That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been 3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:  D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the "dynasty" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a couple of years the same way Edmonton's "dynasty" crumbled in the late '80s. Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  > ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- > J O O J O O J O K E R I T ! ! !

Just because Chaisson barely touched the >poor sap, and he hit the dasher and bled profusely doesn't mean it is a >penalty.  Unfortunately, the instant replay is not used on hits. At first, I immediately thought "5 and a game" because the hit _looked_ much more severe from an intent-to-injure perspective than it was. After seeing the replay, I'd say it deserved 2-4 minutes for boarding (it was careless any way you slice it). If Stewart had replay, I do not think Chaisson would have gotten 5 and the game.  >In the second period, behind Potvin, Probert had the puck, and was >going to get out front, and was _tackled!_ I couldn't believe the no-call.  This no-call was bullshit, I agree. I admire Stewart for letting them go, but Probert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty? I've never seen Probert whine either (he doesn't need to). Now, if Probie decides to put Wendel through the boards, he's probably gone, right?  >I don't remember who (on the Leafs) touched the puck >on Racine's shot towards the end of the game (43.2 seconds left), but Stewart >called it out of play, last touched by Detroit. Everybody in the Garden, >including the Linesmen knew it. Yzerman protested, but Stewart just >laughed, and really "homered" the Wings.  This was also bullshit. But once again, no replay. It was Rouse, btw. I'm really pissed that the linesmen didn't correct the call either....it's b.s. when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake.  >But, when it all comes down to it, [Wings played like shit.....]  Yes. The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit loss. I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin, but the Wings have no excuses for Game 4. They should be the superior team.  The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his stick in somebody's eye. That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I have seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he's an asshole when it comes to stickwork. Four lousy minutes. Bullshit call. Murray should send the tape in. Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out of him.  -- dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca

Washington, Abe Lincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come from the one with David Koresh. Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties, but wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team an advantage? I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this year, whereas many others did. Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about being hit. He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting them up.) Don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so much in his life?  George

It is much easier to be an element of change  Hardly. The "established" situation existed prior to Smythe, et al. The Stanley Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge. What our dear founders did was formalize the challenge. They created a closed league, an oligop- olistic professional system, in the interests of making money. Wheth- er or not that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable. We are, however, stuck with their invention and that de- bate is academic. The point to be made, however, is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey long before Smythe and his pals showed up.  >or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates >a new situation. If you want to honor players like Bobby Orr than I'm sure >you can find a reason to name a torphy after him such as best offensive >defenseman.  What's wrong with best defenceman, period? Was there ever a better defenceman? Was there ever a better player? And if you think that Bruce Norris' contribution was somehow more significant than Bobby Orr's then, in the interests of education, why don't you take a poll and find out how many people know who Norris was?

How the hell can you say the guy is a goon and justify it, with your back-assward mentality? Saying that hurting a player will solve anyone's problems is asinine. New rules and a new referee system need to be instituted. Right now, too many of the real goons get away with too much, because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be:I've seen Koharski and Van Hellemond, to name a few, with their heads up their asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the play. Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties, it would be an improvement.  ********************************************************************************Tim Drozinski drozinst@db.erau.edu "Chew electric death, snarling cur!"

Yes...I know he screwed up letting the King's grab Loach.  Sexton's qualifications (aside from being cheap)??  - he played some US college hockey, - he's pals with club president Bruce Firestone.  Just the kind of experience you need when trying to build an expansion franchise.

(as long as my cable co. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >offers it) ^^^^^^^^^^^  Hopefully EPSN will use the lesson given by the master: Ted Turner. The season Ted introduced TNT, many cable co.'s refused to put it on, saying that, gee we get enough old movies, miniseries, etc. on TBS, USA, AMC, WGN, WOR, why do we need another one? This was in the fall. Come spring, Ted fixed their little red wagons good. The previous spring, NBA playoffs wore on TBS, now they were on TNT (and still are). And everyone gets TNT now.  So, ESPN should put NFL football and baseball on ESPN2, and leave hockey on ESPN. And if cable co.'s play games and drop ESPN in favor of ESPN2, ESPN should alternate baseball and football between channels every week.  But, do the ESPN guys collectively have the gonads of the Turner guy? -- Mike Eisler, mre@Eng.Sun.Com ``Not only are they [Leafs] the best team, but their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburgh's.

  Hi all,  Due to living in the Bay Area, I as unable to see Vancouver's victory over the Jets last night. I know the score, but that rarely describes the game. Could someone please post a brief sonapsis (sp?) of waht happened. How well did each team play? Were the cannucks deserving of the victory?  Also, could some kind soul please email me the end of season, individual player stats?  Greg  -- Vancouver for the cup (in a virtual reality)--
