  When are the Yankees planning on activating Melido Perez? His 15 days on the DL are up today, but are they bringing him back this weekend?  Thanks for any info.  
  Does anybody know what is going on with Lankford? I know he was out for a few games with a slight injury, but since he has beenback (and before the injury for that matter) he has been really struggling at the plate and on the basepaths.

    Hi all,  I've been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week or two without access to really important information. I saw the 3.5 million shoulder back on the DL--How long is he out for (i.e. How many millions/inning will he get this year?) Nothing personal against Higuera mind you, just wondering how Bud can keep coffing up money for him when he lets current big producers go over a relative pittance. (Please realize the term "relative pittance" can only be used with sarcasm when discussing baseball salaries.)  Additional questions: I did'nt get to see Bones pitch this spring--how is he looking and where is he going to fit in the rotation?  How is Surhoff shaping up defensively at third?  Are they going to build a new stadium? When?  Tom
  Subject sez it...  Wondering if either team are in town that weekend (5-30/5-31).  I can probably get Phillies tix, as the Vet can hold a bunch (and I hope they're still in 1st but it's late may, and...).

Please reply directly, to keep the net down to a dull roar...
  How about Matt Nokes 2 run single against Ron Darling. Was that a hit or what? While watching the game yesterday they flashed up something regarding The Boss' talking about Mark Connor as bullpen coach. He said something like it's Mark Connor's fault that the bullpen is so horrible!! Here we go again!! George sticking his non-baseball nose in the baseball business. Shut up George, just spend the money, get the players and leave Buck and the coaches and players alone.

  I like the Clark-WIlliams-Bonds order. Pitchers can only walk Clark with 2 outs (unlike last year).  Williams is getting better pitches to hit with Bonds looming in the on-deck circle. Since Matt has a terrible batting eye, this helps the Giants a lot.  When Bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2nd and then be driven in with a single by Thompson, Manwaring, or Clayton.  If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers, then you don't want him to run because a "caught stealing" could take you out of a big inning.  Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double).  The only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the bases infront of Bonds... and I think that's a problem the Giants will be glad to see especially if Robby Thompson gets hot.

Sure, if a man is tired and needs real rest, then taking a break might be a constructive act. Perhaps if a man is mentally "strained", then sitting him down might help to the extent that that helps him relax.

I hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write, but neither of you two *sound* as though you have kids, and you may not have spouses either.

Runners may advance at own risk.

OUT. See rule 6.05(L) APPROVED RULING. (Below). In this case, the umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule doesn't apply. (Sounds like a bad call here, but that's not the point). The batter is not out, so a force situation is created. Therefore, the runner is out. ( UNLESS, by rule 6.05(L) the ball is dead AND the batter is safe, then I guess the runners would advance unmolested. I can't really tell from 6.05(L) that the ball is dead in this situation.)  |> |> What's the call in (A) and (B)?  Pertinent rules: 2.00 Definition of Infield Fly: "When an Infield fly is called, runners may advance at their own risk. If on an infield fly rule, the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball, the ball remains in play despite the provisions of Rule 6.05(L). The Infield Fly rule takes precedence."  6.05(L) A batter is out when: an infielder intentionally drops a fair fly ball or line drive, with first, first and second, first and thrid, or first,second and third base occupied before two are out. The ball is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base or bases. APPROVED RULING: In this situation, the batter is not out if the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground, except when the infield fly rule applies.  -- Jim Dean (Internet: jimdean@bnr.ca) +-----+ National Capital Baseball League mild-mannered computer scientist -->|Phone|--> President.

  Usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been incredible. Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms. I remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds. The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey. To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo. Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional. (Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray. The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties. With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the horizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be.

Wait a minute. I missed something here. First, forget Keith Mitchell. Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA and then does not improve would have been better off making a direct leap to the majors? If a player does well at AA and then does not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't belong in the bigs?  Now, Keith Mitchell. As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!) he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991. He did so well that he was returned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all. Now his career is in jeopardy. So how does he fit in with your point. Good MLE's in AA. Moved him right to the big club. Now he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball. Duh.   >That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they >really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience, >or some combination of the two.

This is important since he struggles > so much with breaking balls. Opposing pitchers don't want to > walk Williams to get to Bonds.  Both your reasons are not good ones. Joe Morgan thinks that Bonds-Clark- Williams should be the 3-4-5 hitters. While he believes that Clark-Bonds- Williams is fine, he definitely is of the opinion that Bonds should hit ahead of Williams. I am inclined to agree with him. Your first reason is not valid because Bonds can hit both lefties and righties very well. He hits lefties or righties better than any other Giant Williams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season. But, the bottom line is Bonds is a far more disciplined and more productive hitter than Williams, and I prefer to take my chances with Bonds driving in the 1, 2 or 3 hitters (who are expected to have high OBPs) than with Williams. Williams would get more fastballs with Bonds on first and second base open because of the threat of Bonds stealing.

This may be the root of the confusion...  Please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind. Note that I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand.  Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game. You pick a number from 1-10 and win if that number is drawn. Suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week.  In the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population will win 7 or more times.  In the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again be 7-time winners.  In the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in each of the first two years will win 7 again.  Suppose I started with 1024 people in my population. After three years, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last three years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.  Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game? No. Because we know there is no skill involved. Nothing about these "consistent winners" can influence their chances of winning. But suppose we *don't* know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved. Perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic, or something. How would we test this hypothesis?  We can look for correlations in the population. Now most of the population will show zero correlation. But our psychics should show a high positive correlation (even if they aren't very good psychics, they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years). Net result? A small positive correlation over the entire population.  >This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having >with others on this topic. Must any conclusion based on statistical >history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before >it has any validity? Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply >statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?  Well, zero correlation is zero correlation. You mention that Sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years. But if we look at the past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent. The length of the streak doesn't seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year. Is there any reason to expect *this* streak to be different from past streaks?  Now if it were true that "75% of all three-year streaks remained true to form", then we might have something useful. But then we wouldn't have zero correlation. Instead we have "50% of all three-year streaks remain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse". You look at those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year". But it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each way.  >I completely accept that reasoning. Again, what if we were to find >the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent >basis?  Then we would have something useful. And we would also have a positive correlation. But for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses.  Cheers, -Valentine

He was making a protest about the lack of an appeal to first. As has been pointed out earlier, there is no appeal to first on a strike. I can understand Gant feeling a little pressure in a two-out, RISP, 1 - 0 game, ninth inning. He let it get to him. The ump also overreacted. Gant was stalking off, but I doubt he would have been gone long. Hirschbeck should have let him have a moment to compose himself before telling him to come bat. IMHO, umpires should be more flexible than what Hirschbeck showed. Gant was disturbed to the point it was pretty likely he would not get a hit.  A very bad finish to a pretty good game. >-- >Dale J.

    The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.  Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run. He stroked a line drive into the right field corner. The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd. Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball. A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball. Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's. Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry. What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it; he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing. He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man. All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game. Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch. Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area. In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss. Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about winning. L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play. Was the fan wrong? Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference? Or was he human and just reacting? By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line. Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster    -- Mark Singer mss@netcom.com

  Tim Belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as Cincinnati won their second straight 5-0. Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and often by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some recently rare power with their bats.  Belcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the game progressed. Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while striking out nine. In a post game interview he said his change-up was working for him--I should say so: all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on breaking balls.  Tomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch double to lead-off batter Bip Roberts. Bobby Kelly followed with a single and Barry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right. The big guys (Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact they all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal and a Tomlin wild pitch.  In fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky start-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only 2-0. Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was poorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple. Milligan would later score on Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead after 4.  The fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second double of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the left field line, chasing Tomlin. Barry later would score the final run on Tom Prince's two-base passed ball.  The Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the fifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second being of the "bunt" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a foul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith "K'd" to end any Pittsburgh hope.  Pittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though: relievers Blas Minor, Moeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings work.  Barry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played bruised his right thumb. He was taken to the hospital for "precautionary X-rays". Let's hope he's OK.  Cincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the two wins they may be looking at moving out of the cellar! Pittsburgh is now 7-6.  *********REDS FANS*************************** If you would like to receive this report on a semi-daily basis (as often as I write it), send me your e-mail address and I'll put you on the list.

I can believe that. I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word. But Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.

Baseball is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.  I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision. While you from your armchair may disagee, I don't. I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made. I predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training. I think it is a very *normal* decision to have made. It is certainly more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers. Sure, it may be conservative. It may also be logical. I don't know what ethics have to do with it. Seems like pretty good common sense to me.  -- The Beastmaster   -- Mark Singer mss@netcom.com

  I watched the final inning of Bosio's no-hitter with several people at work. After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he wouldn't have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Riles by about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand. Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an error or a hit? (Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bounced past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether Vizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.    -- -------------------------- Phil Brown | aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu | --------------------------

Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who "hasn't matured as quickly as they would have liked. Mahomes is a 22 year-old who is very highly touted. Tapani and Erickson are also young, and have looked very good this spring. The last spot was between Jim Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.

Minor point: Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but not with the Jets in mind as the tennant. The New York Football Giants had moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was having problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee Stadium until 1972). The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea. When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the new AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using the new stadium. The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the Cosmos played soccer in the 70s). Because Shea Stadium was tied into the World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing with the Mets). So the deal was worked out.  >Of course, with the Jets gone to Jersey (and a truly good football >stadium), the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where, >because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the >action.

The score is now 7-5, with XXX's team still on top.  I contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be "he is a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win."  If XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be "he is an inexperienced rookie who doesn't know how to pitch. Needs more seasoning. Send him to AAA.

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for argument's sake, define "rushed" as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing? I'm serious; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are any. I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats. (It's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was "rushed", although there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career. Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season. He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22, and still underperformed. However, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since. It's really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being "rushed"; Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him.  Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle. But does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts performing up to expectations?

Morris did. > The problem with your nihilistic approach, Roger, is that it takes all the sense out of the game. By your line of reasoning, if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded, there's no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise, so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons. After all, any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn't.  Roger, do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead? Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence?  Teams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else in their division. If they don't make the post-season, they don't win the Series. Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring-collecting?  If so, you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division, and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games.  In your viewpoint as expressed, winning games happens for reasons that cannot be analyzed. While many of us are thinking things like "Base- runners are good, outs are bad, and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded", you are thinking things like "It's a team game, so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today".  The result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual players. Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left field. After all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it. Therefore, I could be an extremely valuable player. Did Dave Winfield have anything to do with the Jays' victory? Probably, but how do you know? If you replace him with Andres Galarraga, perhaps the Jays would have won, perhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to Alpha Centauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid-season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto).  Was Babe Ruth a good player? He played on some WS-winning teams, but did he have anything to do with their success?  It is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player, and Jarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren't. It seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof.  Now, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empirically and by looking at the rulebook. It is necessary to score more runs than one's opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one's opponent from scoring. Runs are scored while a team is batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good. Players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year.  We do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you. To make some flat predictions: Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG than Gene Larkin this year. The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies in the standings. The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals, but will also give up more. I would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false, and, I suspect, so would you. As a matter of fact, I am pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year, given 3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than random chance (and almost statistically significant).  If you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in the World Series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods, however fuzzy. > >It is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally >meaningless. > So how about "real life"?

IMO, the Royals don't have a chance to win the pennant even if McRae suddenly began channeling for John McGraw. OK, they have some decent pitchers. But when your offense consists of bums like Gagne and Lind and McReynolds and McRae and an over-the-hill Brett, you're not going to finish .500 unless McGraw brings Christy Mathewson back with him.

A summary of the findings:  Over the 5 year period, sac-fly type fly balls were produced 17.6 percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful, and 17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly wasn't useful.  They looked at the leaders in sac flies, and found that the leaders in sac flies - in other words, the guys you would expect to be good at it it - hit sac fly type fly balls only 3% more often when they needed to - a difference way too small to be the result of a skill. Essentially, the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often, with and without a runner on third.  STATS concludes "So it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit sacrifice flies on purpose - even if they practice in the bATTING cage."  gREG
  So THAT'S what happened to Denny McLain. Sad.  For those of you who are interested, another baseball pariah, Pete Rose, has a weekday radio show on the Sports and Entertainment national radio network. I think it's 3-5 PM locally, 6-8 PM on the East coast.  And actually, his on-air monologues about the baseball business sounds a lot more reasonable and articulate than what I hear from the Ray Knights of the world. -- Greg "Mockingbird" Franklin "Interracial mixing encompasses a lot lot more f67709907@ccit.arizona.edu than mingling between G7 races." -- robohen  Stodgy Things Argument by an inept speaker.

   Buck Showalter just can't win.  Bob Wickman's pitching the game of his life through eight innings (Yanks lead 6-1), so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete game. Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score, and all of a sudden it's 6-5, and Wickman just can't get the third out. So Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces.  Last night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his life (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yanks lead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, "I don't want a repeat of that near-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work." Steve Howe, whose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didn't do too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and the Royals win it, 6-5.  What's going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year that the bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together, Monteleone's done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once. What's the deal? We finally have terrific starting pitching, so all of a sudden, our bullpen turns to shit!  What's Buck gonna do? And what's George gonna do if this continues to happen?  -Alan

Why would they care?  There's a strong possibility that the Bucs have absolutely no other catching prospects in the minors at this point -- at least nobody ready for any serious AAA/majors duty. The main reason they might have stayed with Prince could be just age, especially if Spanky was creeping toward his mid-30s or something.  All things considered, though, I'd be a lot more comfortable with Spanky behind the plate than Prince.

I'm sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance. You just wouldn't have used this particular aspect of prior performance. Is this not correct?   >I'll try to avoid being insulting.

Wait a minute. I thought I first had to define clutch hitting. Do I, or don't I?  >You have made strong statements. Now back them up or be proven a >total idiot.  I made two statements in my post.  1. I am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting.  2. I would have hit for Sabo.   As for #2, many of us make a number of written statements through this media about what we think will happen in baseball. I'm not shy about it. I'll make the statement again. I believe that by season's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non-clutch situations. I can't prove that it will happen, so I guess we'll just have to wait and see.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Here's another one for you. In 1989 - 1991 Joe Carter's batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in non-clutch situations each year. I presume you think this is random.  Non-Clutch: 1585 AB 411 H .259 Clutch: 338 AB 68 H .201  So what could we expect in 1992 from Mr. Carter?  Well, his composite BA through 1989 was .268; through 1990 was .262; through 1991 was .263, so I think we have a pretty good idea of what kind of batting average he can produce. In 1992 he hit .264. Not surprising, huh? Also in 1992:  Non-Clutch: 536 AB 144 H .269 Clutch: 86 AB 20 H .233  No, this doesn't prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of major league ballplayers. It just makes me think that in 1993 Joe Carter's batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in non-clutch situations. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  As for #1 (above), I have plenty of company. John Dewan of STATS,INC. is the editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding clutch hitting are compiled, reported and referenced in the text. Bill James makes numerous references to a player's ability to hit well in the clutch. I am not saying that I can predict the future any more than they are. You (and others) are saying that your work renders their statements (and mine) meaningless. I don't accept that, which in your words proves that I am a "total idiot".   "Stupid". "Total idiot".

The Cubs are worse  The 1961 Angels were 1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and expansion Senators finished tied for last. The 1962 Colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last). The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last). The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).

I don't think that the All-Star team will be able to beat  This may be an appropriate comparison. The 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing 18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first. In 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only 7, 7 and 3 games out). Even great teams can lose - That's why they play the season. (on the other hand...

That's why he lost 18 for Detroit in 1990. Funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but loses a lot when he pitches on bad ones. And if "rings" was the only criteria for success, then teams would always tend to repeat, and eventually you'd have the same team win the WS every bleepin' year. Sort of like the yanks in the 50s.  Morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good, not great, career. Toronto will finish 3rd or 4th this year, with Morris and all those rings, because their pitching staff was destroyed over the off-season.  Steve Thornton stevet@eskimo.com

I compare the performance of the 1992 Phillies with the 1987 edition, which had outstanding run producers at every position except SS, yet finished at a frustrating sub-.500 level. The 1987 folks didn't ever amount to anything, and neither will the 1992 squad, IMHO.

  Has David Wells landed with a team yet? I'd think the Tigers with their anemic pitching would grab this guy pronto!  DC 
  My father is a huge Tiger fan, and I am a loyal Blue Jay fan, who endured the collapse of 87, the heartbreak of 85.  I don't have the stat book, so let's throw them out.  First of all, Morris in his heyday (81-88) vs Clemens (86-present).  How many Cy Youngs does Morris have?  How many Cy youngs does Clemens have?  Ballparks and such... Fenway average pitchers park. Detroit, hugh hitters paradise.  Morris is a great team pitcher, sort of in the Doug Drabek mold. If Morris's team needs a well pitched game, as in Minn in 91, Morris snaps the ball, and throw for Ks. Otherwise, he just tries to get people out.  As for Clemens, in the Elias Stat Book of 1992, I believe that Clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared to when he doesn't pitch. How bad would the Red sox have been last year without him? Can you say 92 Phillies?  I believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi great tenacity. Morris is among the guttiest pitchers I;ve ever seen, but Clemens is in a class with Seaver, Carlton, etc.  Paul sparks

OK, you guys stirred up my childhood memories, so I went and did some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season. It turns out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate, at least as far as the Phillies record goes. On September 1 1964 this was the top of the N.L. standings:  W L GB Philadelphia 79 51 - Cincinnati 74 57 5 1/2 St. Louis 72 59 7 1/2 San Francisco 73 60 7 1/2  This is a game-by-game description of the remainder of the Phillies' season:  Date Score Opponent Lead Pitcher (starting and winner/loser) 9/1 4-3 Houston 5 1/2 Bunning (15-4) 9/2 2-1 Houston 5 1/2 Short (15-7) 9/3 0-6 Houston 5 1/2 Bennett (9-12) 9/4 5-3 San Francisco 6 1/2 Mahaffey; Baldschun (6-5) 9/5 ??Win San Francisco 6 1/2 Bunning (16-4) 9/6 3-4 San Francisco 5 1/2 Short; Baldschun (6-6) 9/7 5-1 Los Angeles Bennett (10-12) 1-3 Los Angeles 6 1/2 Wise (5-3) 9/8 2-3 Los Angeles 6 Mahaffey (12-7) 9/9 5-10/11 St. Louis 5 Bunning; Baldschun (6-7) (Cardinals take over 2nd place from Cincinnati) 9/10 5-1 St. Louis 6 Short (16-7) 9/11 1-0 San Francisco 6 Bennett (11-12) 9/12 1-9 San Francisco 6 Mahaffey (12-8) (Giants move into a tie for 2nd with St. Louis) 9/13 4-1/10 San Francisco 6 Bunning (17-4) (Cardinals back in sole possesion of 2nd place) 9/14 4-1 Houston 6 1/2 Short (17-7) 9/15 1-0 Houston 6 Bennett (12-12) 9/16 5-6 Houston 6 Bunning (17-5) 9/17 4-3 Los Angeles 6 1/2 Wise; Schantz (2-4) 9/18 3-4 Los Angeles 6 Short; Baldschun (6-8) 9/19 3-4/16 Los Angeles 5 1/2 Bennett; Baldschun (6-9) 9/20 3-2 Los Angeles 6 1/2 Bunning (18-5) (Reds move back into tie for 2nd with Cardinals)  Well so far so good for the Phillies. But now it all falls apart ...  9/21 0-1 Cincinnati 5 1/2 Mahaffey (12-9) (Reds take sole possesion of 2nd place) 9/22 2-9 Cincinnati 4 1/2 Short (17-8) 9/23 4-6 Cincinnati 3 1/2 Bennett (12-13) 9/24 3-5 Milwaukee 3 Bunning (18-6) 9/25 5-7/12 Milwaukee 1 1/2 Short; Boozer (3-4) (Cards now 2 1/2 back in 3rd, Giants 3 1/2 in 4th) 9/26 4-6 Milwaukee 1/2 Mahaffey; Schantz (2-5) 9/27 8-14 Milwaukee -1 Bunning (18-7) (Phils lose 7 1/2 games in 7 days; Reds take over 1st, Cardinals 1 1/2 back in 3rd) 9/28 1-5 St. Louis -1 1/2 Short(17-9) (Cardinals take over 2nd place, Phils drop to 3rd) 9/29 2-4 St. Louis -1 1/2 Bennett (12-14) (Reds and Cardinals now tied for 1st) 9/30 5-8 St. Louis -2 1/2 Bunning (18-8) (Cardinals take 1/2 game lead over Reds) 10/1 4-3 Cincinnati -1 1/2 Short; Roebuck (5-3) (Phillies halt 10-game losing streak; Cards lead Reds by 1/2 game) 10/2 Did not play; Cards lose to Mets, Reds tied for 1st, Phils 1 game back 10/3 10-0 Cincinnati -1 Bunning (19-8) (Cards beat Mets, take first by 1 from Reds and Phillies)  Whew! what a finish! And the final standings were:  W L GB St. Louis 93 69 - Philadelphia 92 70 1 Cincinnati 92 70 1 San Francisco 90 72 3  Now it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short were really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of the day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the Phillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league. Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch.  ----- Eric Smith erics@netcom.com erics@infoserv.com CI$: 70262,3610

Well, we'll see. I've got a Astros pullover shirt with the "Astros stripes" across the shoulders and I have trouble making myself wear it in public. i can see why they might want that to change.

  I missed the original post, but aren't the Expos rushing alomost their entire team this year? I am from Montreal, and am a fan, but geez, the Expos rank 27th in salary (only the Rockies trail) and someone at the average age would probably be in first year University! CorelMARK! 
  I'm sure all of you have heard of the extraordiary start by rookie J.T. Snow of the California Angeles. Other than the fact that his father was a star receiver with the L.A. Rams and is now a radio personality in Los Angeles and J.T. came from the Yankees organization I don't know much about J.T. If anyone has info and background on the young fenom....please post.  By the way, for those of you not following his exploits he has hit four home runs in three days. Two last night. He has also delivered the winning hit a couple of times for the Angeles in this young season.  Thanks...  Michael from USC

I can't begin to fathom why the Pirates have been so afraid of losing this guy, who's been in AAA most of the last 5 seasons. The Pirates released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options, then eventually sent Prince down anyway, and he cleared waivers without a peep. He's another year older, and still can't hit; why do they think he wouldn't clear waivers now? Why would they care?  Sherri Nichols snichols@adobe.com

Gant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck. Not returning made the strike call fairly likely. Although I suspect an argument might have gotten Gant tossed altogether.

  Disclaimer -- This is for fun.  In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called "stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not make with average effort." Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays Juan Gonzalez would not have made."  OK, I realize that's unfair. Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor. But let's put it this way: If we replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 55.4% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make. By the same method I've calculated Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->. Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team. So don't take it too seriously. The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.  The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases -- Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate. DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

Basically, it's designed to be added into the OPS, with the idea that "a run prevented is as important as a run scored". The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are factored into SLG. That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

Range is not the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman. The ability to field all sorts of balls thrown to him: digging some out of the dirt, stretching for others, and so forth is important. Thus, putouts do provide some information. Maybe what we need is a comparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the first baseman vs. how many he actually got.   -- Jim Mann Stratus Computer jmann@vineland.pubs.stratus.com 
  o any of you experts want to analyze Ron Gant? Is his early season slump because he is still swinging his bat the way he was last year (trying to hit to all fields, etc.) or has he changed his swing back to the "old" Gant and is just in a small early season slump.  Is his spot int he lineup even secure, especially the way he has been hitting?  -- msilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu GO CUBS!!!  "One likes to believe in the freedom of baseball" - Geddy Lee

Meanwhile, I think bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something in 1993. Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to the Bucs' future.  >14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it.

Those are the arguments against Lopez for the >Braves for this year.  But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle- of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW.  Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.  >Now.

The kid *will* improve playing at AAA, and >he probably won't being a reserve with the big club.  Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players. Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as "TWG" without the caps. It's a losing strategy to say, "We have solid guys, we don't need to improve." You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.  Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years, Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference, IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.  "Two big bats." Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing. Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA. (Got that, Mike?)  And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?  >goodness.

  To all the Braves doubters:  Don't worry. The bats will come alive, and the Braves will come around. The pitching is solid, and as long the Braves don't have serious injuries to the starting rotation, they'll continue to pitch well. Heck, with the five starters on the Braves rotation, they could even sustain an injury to one of the five (I hope this doesn't happen, though).  The bats are there... Pendleton will certainly bat over .280, Justice is catching fire, Bream, Nixon, Sanders, Gant... well, there's too much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer. Right now, the Cleveland Indians have 7 players batting over .300! But I certainly wouldn't their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn't the Braves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting over .300?).  The bullpen... well, it IS suspect. But when the bats come alive, the guys in the bullpen will be of less concern.  So anyway, I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season. I'm not saying the Braves have automatically won the division, but I'm optim- istic about their season (though it's awful painful to watch them at times right now).  Go Braves!!!  Dean.

It has something to do with the fact that we live in America, and everyone is entitled to whatever he can legally obtain. If Sandy Alderson and the Haas family willingly negotiate a salary of $35 million per year with Rickey, I couldn't care less.  But what REALLY GETS MY GOAT is the bullshit he spouted in spring training, about `Well... sometimes I may not play as hard, or might be hurt more often, in a place where I'm not appreciated'. This quote was in the Chronicle about the second week of camp, and strongly suggests that he was going to dog it all year if the ownership didn't kiss his butt and ante up some more money. For God's sake, Rickey, you signed a contract 4 years ago, now honor it and play!  Say all you want to about Steve Garvey, and believe me, I hated him too, but at least when he put his signature on a piece of paper he shut his mouth and played hard until the contract was up.

As far as I know, Toronto, Pittsburgh, and New York (NL) change their uniforms every year. Every other year (e.g., New York), it will say Mets in cursive, New York in cursive, or New York in all caps. Minor changes, but they do change them often. Last year, I think they had New York in all caps. Did Toronto have Blue Jays or Toronto last year?

   The Phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings. Last night's game was hard fought. The game in Chicago should have been a blow out. All in all these two games show a different Phillies team. In past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of 1 run games. I don't know how many times I saw them losing by only 1 run. If they were able to win most of those, they might have been more of a contending team. They are 3-0 so far in extra innings. And of course, they are 10-3.

  You want to speed up ballgames?  1. Enforce the two minutes between innings. As it is, many fields are allowing THREE minutes between them. Fifteen seconds before TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon the return to the game. Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or a ball is called.  2. Don't grant time to batters just because they want it. They may get pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.  3. Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches (the current rule is too lenient), and then enforce it. Fifteen seconds is more than enough time. If the pitch isn't released in 15, call it a ball, and restart the clock.  Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours in the AL. That's just too damn long. I don't like to PLAY in 3 hour games, much less WATCH a game for that long. My butt falls asleep, and if I'm watching on TV, I'll channel surf between pitches, catching colorized versions of Mr. Ed, Leave it to Beaver, and "Those Wacky Nieporents" on Nick at Nite.   -- * Gary Huckabay * "You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?" * * "Movie Rights * "Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir, * * available thru * I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

  I thought I'd post my predicted standings since I find those posted by others to be interesting. Sorry this is after Opening Day. I certify that these were completed before the first pitch. :-)  AL East 1. New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division 2. Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris? No way. 3. Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect 4. Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop 5. Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing 6. Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak 7. Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th  Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick. Whoever of the top 4 gets pitching should win it. 1. Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success 2. Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here. Jose Canseco? 3. Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching. 4.

  Don't knock Vaughn for being a spring training .400 hitter but a .250 regular season hitter. Around 30 games played isn't an indication of how good any hitter is, and the quality of pitching is way down.  Ryan Robbins Penobscot Hall University of Maine  IO20456@Maine.Maine.Edu

Well, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net with his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me.  The way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth, and I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent average) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I compared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and here's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above replacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6; 1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks substantially right.  In the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of .180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is "Billy Ripken". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I have set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs are proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded off for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have: Randy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo Gomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271) in left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.  So, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of batting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55, 30 batting, 25 fielding.  Total RAR (bat/field)  1. Bonds 152 (124/28) Ventura 124 (66/58) 2. Sandberg 143 (88/55) Thomas 122 (110/12) 3. Van Slyke 122 (91/31) Anderson 109 (75/34) 4. Grace 114 (70/44) Raines 100 (68/32) 5. Lankford 111 (76/35) Puckett 98 (76/22) 6. Pendleton 108 (71/37) Alomar 98 (75/23) 7. Finley 104 (70/34) Martinez E 97 (81/16) 8. Bagwell 101 (73/28) Mack 93 (70/23) 9. Butler 96 (74/22) McGwire 93 (79/14) 10 Sheffield 96 (85/11) Griffey 92 (70/22) 11 Larkin 96 (65/31) Devereaux 89 (56/34) 12 Grissom 95 (57/38) Henderson 88 (66/23) 13 Walker 94 (61/33) Listach 87 (50/37) 14 Justice 92 (52/40) Lofton 85 (46/39) 15 W.

Bell 79 (42/37) Gonzalez 73 (60/13)  Notable entries in a per-400 batting out rating, NL: top 7 are Bonds, 177, LF; Sandberg, 130, 2b; Van Slyke, 114, cf; Grace, 107, 1b; Larkin, 102, ss; Justice, 99, rf; Sheffield, 99, 3B. One at each position measured! McGriff, despite +85 batting RAR, fifth in league, finishes out of the top 20 due to a -13 in fielding. Last by position: Galarraga 39, Stillwell -10, Hansen 30, Belliard 30 (Blauser gad a 69, 3rd in league), May 43, Dascenzo 34, Anthony 38.  In the AL, much-maligned Rickey Henderson was worth 120, second only to Frank Thomas' 124; Ventura edges Edgar at third, 116-111; Grebeck rates a potent 102!; Griffey edges Puckett as top CF, 93-90; Listach nudges out Lofton among rookies, 82-80. And Alomar clearly outpoints Baerga, 97-73. Last by position: Segui 10, Sojo 29, Palmer 22, Lewis 31, Polonia 40, Cuyler 26, V. Hayes 39.  All for now.  Clay D.

Between Stone, Koufax, Ken Holtzman (? might have the wrong pitcher, I'm thinking of the one who threw a no-hitter in both the AL and NL), and Big Ed Reulbach, that's quite a starting rotation. Moe Berg can catch. Harry Steinfeldt, the 3b in the Tinkers-Evers-Chance infield.  Is Stanky Jewish? Or is that just a "Dave Cohen" kinda misinterpretation?

  Hell, the Orioles' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history if we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89). On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter. Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando. Baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive AL East. __________________________________________________________________________ |Admiral Steve C.

He's nowhere near as bad as Steve >Garvey, but that's not much of a compliment.  I agree with the flavor of this post, but disagree with one specific argument. That "has great hands" means nothing. It seems to me that a first-baseman's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily) from his ability to field grounders or catch popups. How many such chances does he get during a game? Many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these is much higher than Grounder/Popup totals). This implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line or in the dirt. "Good Hands" are needed for such plays, and thus have value. I don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays, but I'd guess that the values of these abilities are similar. It's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups. (But not as marked I suppose).  Michael

  One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't yet been addressed. I believe the rule also does *not* deal with this situation:  If Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up and advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball.  However, if the Infield Fly is *not* caught, at what point can a runner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for advancing too early? When the ball hits the ground? When a fielder first touches the ball after it hits the ground?  Enlightenment would be appreciated.  Jay

  In a Philadelphia Inquirer a few days ago, it was reported that there were two (2) plans for a new Phillies stadium: the already-mentioned 30th Street Station proposal, and a location near Broad Street and Race Street, I think. I can't remember the exact details, but the stadium would be build practically downtown. There is a small lot that could be used, according to the paper. The 30th street plan has run into some trouble, because Amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to accomodate the stadium. I don't have an opinion just yet, just letting everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now. Neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon, however, because nobody wants to pay for it :-)  -- Keith Keller LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

He had a great career, but I would prefer Santo's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman.  But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack.

Another question, Is Derek Lilliquist the main closer for the Indians now that Olin is gone. I need to know cause I need to find a reliever to replace Wetteland and so far Lilliquist is doing ok. Any information on either of the players would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.   Ryan Robin.  ___________________________________________________________  [==================] Texas Rangers in 1993! [==================] Jose Canseco for MVP. [==] [==] [==] [==] [==] [==] Ryan N.

  As of today, April 17, Jack Morris has lost his first three starts.  However, the Jays are doing well without him and injured Dave Stuart.  This is a credit to the rest of the pitching staff.  Has Jack lost a bit of his edge? What is the worst start Jack Morris has had?  
  Does any one out there listen to WFAN? For those of you who do not know what I am talking about, it is an all sports radio staion in New York. On a clear night the signal reaches up and down the East coast. In particular, I want to know how Len Berman and Mike Lupica's show is. I go to school in Virginia so I can't listen when there are on during the day. Just wondering.  Jonathan Alboum UVA  PS. Did any one see Steve Sommers on 48 hours last night. The Chief was on too, doing Rangers Round up. It was pretty neat shmoozing S P O R T S on TV.

I'm afraid I can't get the short version to work.  In any case, on Winfield. Yes, his career BA is a mere .285. He didn't beat this until his sixth year in the majors, and has only topped it once since 1988. His peak was in the early '80s, and included some rather impressive seasons. But then he's also had other scattered great performances (like 1988 and 1992). Definitely *not* a smooth career curve!  Cheers, -Valentine

Alright, that's enough. I've suffered with all kinds of insults (as typical for the net), but give me a break. Galarraga is currently batting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawing enough walks. What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000? You can hardly claim that he is "hurting his team".  If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen), *THEN* I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches. My comment that "he isn't paid to walk" doesn't mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs; it's more along the lines of: he's batting .400 and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference does it make if he isn't drawing a lot of walks? Sheesh.  --Greg
  The O's just lost to the Rangers a few minutes ago I was not too happy about the pitching of Rick Sutcliffe (6 runs in 6 innings, 5 in the 3?) This puts me in remembering the 1990 O's season. After '89 we didn't do much over winter and we wound up in 5th. Now I know that Mussina, McDonald, and Rhodes are better pitching prospects than Ballard and Milacki but are any other Oriole fans scared out there?  Admiral Steve C. Liu  P.S. Other scores as of now. Cincy over Montreal, 2-1 I think FLORIDA IS LEADING LA 6-3 IN THE 8TH! Braves vs. Cubs, 1-0 in the 8th. Futility of Cubs batting haunting them. Yanks beat the Tribe I believe. ____________________________________________________________________________ |Admiral Steve C.

   I would e-mail this to you, but my mailserver doesn't recognize you or something.  Anyway, the worst pitcher on the Yanks. If you mean currently on the team, then I have to go with Scott "I'm a schizophrenic...No, I'm NOT!" Kamienicki. Sure, occasionally the guy can pitch well for 5 or 6 innings, but then he starts to go insane. A sure sign that he's losing his stuff (and his mind) is when he starts to stalk around the mound between batters and yell at himself.  The worst all-time Yanks pitcher? Gotta go with Ed "New York? I have to pitch in [gulp] New York?" Whitson.

  Were they palying football or baseball in Detroit on Saturday? From looking at the school, some people may think it was football. Between two games this week, the Tigers scored 40 runs!!!! The offense can carry them, I hope the pitching will hold out. I was at Camden Yards yesterday, everytime I looked up the score was getting higher. What a great site it was to see the Tigers kicking butt while enjoying a game at Camden Yards. GO TIGERS AND GO TONY PHILLIPS!!!!!!!!

Gee, can these guys even compare to I agree, Garvey and Morris don't deserve it.  >the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?  Well, based on your argument, Nolan Ryan doesn't deserve the Hall of Fame. He is just a right hander who stuck around for a long time and could throw hard. Very few 20 game winning seasons, lots of losing seasons, lots of walks. No Cy Young awards. How does Nolan Ryan compare to a guy like Steve Carlton who dominated 5 or 6 Major League seasons, won 7 divisons, 2 World Series, and won half of his teams games in 1972? He doesn't compare. Not even close.  Kirby Puckett hasn't done it long enough for me. Give me 5 more seasons like he's been having, then I'll think about it. 
  Last week I posted the ALL-TIME GREATEST PLAYERS (and haphazardly misspelled several names--SORRY!) This week, it's time for the greatest PEAK players.

The Ack man is apparently an alien life-form, much like the pod people from planet Mars, who can take on any form (the ability remains the same, however). The Ack-people have been spotted on many teams to date, but it appears that the Orioles staff (mentioned above) and the Expos bullpen (Barnes, Walton, Fassero, Gardiner and Rojas) have been the prime target. Apparently John Wetteland was roughed up by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his system rejected the takeover, and has been on the DL ever since. Contact the authorities! This evil plot must be stopped! (the Ack-people can keep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman, though.

Well, your idea of "interesting" differs from mine. I think batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it. I think the delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game. Of course, the umpires can, and should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand. As Ryan Robbins has pointed out, there are rules that cover this.  One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its open-endedness with regard to time. You never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to go on until four in the morning. Likewise, some games are action-packed, and some games are slow and lazy. That's fine by me. Those folks who want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel- surf and cater to their short attention spans.  Heather HHENDERSON@vax.clarku.edu

Baltimore Baseblazers? Where the hell did you come up with that? The Orioles are not a base-stealing team except for Anderson. Besides we would never call them anything but the Baltimore Orioles. Why? The ballpark has all these orthologically (spelling error?) correct BALTIMORE ORIOLES all over the place. I bet you thought the bird is just an oriole. It's not. The bird was named after Lord Baltimore when Maryland was founded. They're called Baltimore Orioles. But the post is just a joke so why do I care what a non-O's fan thinks of us? But I still wonder where Baseblazers came from. San Diego Padres, now there's a name that needs to be changed. How is padre being used?

   I was watching the Dodgers/Marlins game yesterday and a couple of things impressed me.  First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball. In comparison Wrigley Field in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans.  The second and most important was the fans. I like these guys/gals! I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball. It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the Miami Dolphins. The way they were cheering, I thought it was the AFC playoffs. Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it, but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities.  Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement. We'll find out Friday how Denver Bronco fans respond.  Phillies are 2-0!

Brock, Coleman, and Wilson were hot-dog basestealers (also Lonnie Smith); that seems to be a special class.

We have no way of knowing whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it wasn't for all the other people on the planet. We have no way of knowing how the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet, because living on this planet is a team effort. And no individual committs a crime totally isolated from his society; he is a part of that society. That being case, anything I have to say on his culpability would be absolute subjectivity, so I refuse to vote."  Greg

  Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can predict a player's RBIs using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP) that he bats with. In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs. This completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 could do, since context was unknown to it. So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.  I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990. (I don't have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.) If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get  (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level. So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level. I've no started to move on to the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly). I hope to add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie. The results:  RBI-HR Years Actual Predicted Carter (84-88,90) 400 402.6 Clark (87,88,90,92) 269 269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90) 471 460.8 Smith (84-88,90) 317 280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

  Just to add to this vein, consider that range of a first baseman is not the only important thing. He is IMO the best fielder of bad throws from the other infielders. I have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt, catch balls off a large bounce, take down balls over his head, wide, etc. ad infinitum. *And* he gets the out, much of the time. Some of the things he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing. You have to give Mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot near the bag (yes, I am sure he gets a few calls because he is Mattingly :-)  -- Keith Keller LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!! kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!

Dave Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of Fame. Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players of all time.

If Puckett and Ryan (okay, no if there) get into to the Hall, they will be marginal Hall of Famers (unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for a while longer)  To put this in perspective, here's a listing of the linear weights values of the careers of the players you mention. In parenthesis is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it. While no one would claim these are perfect rankings, they should give you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players.  Robin Yount 43.0 (41) Ozzie Smith 42.1 (45) Dave Winfield 40.3 (53) Eddie Murray 37.5 (68) Darrel Evans 35.2 (80) Kirby Puckett 24.3 (180) Nolan Ryan 21.6 (219) Jack Morris 11.8 (478) Dave Kingman 0.4 Steve Garvey -5.8  To give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall: Of the 71 eligible players whose career stats equaled 35.0, 64 are in the Hall of Fame. The ones who aren't include 4 19th century players, Ron Santo, Bobby Grich, and Bob Johnson.  Of those eligible who score between 30.0 and 34.9, 15 of 25 are in. Of those eligible who score between 25.0 and 29.9, 24 of 44 are in.   Greg

  Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all AL players with at least 10 at bats.  It is early in the season so there are some very high numbers.

Uh, the original author's point was that black and white players were por- trayed differently by "the media", and towards this, he gave a highly selected list to "prove" his case. Sanders' name showed up eventually. I dispute that Sanders has ever been called lazy by "the media".  >>Hmm, big ego, possible club house disturbance, etc. Is that GOOD press? > >No, but it isn't the total extent of the press he received in >Pittsburgh, where he was called all kinds of things including lazy and >spoiled by the local columnists.

Uh, that poster specifically stated "allow me to be the first". It is NOT a quibble, then, to state that "the media" did not portray Canseco as being lazy. If the other person chooses to so accuse him, after my post, that does not make it a quibble. And in fact, the media around here tend(ed) to play up his time in the wieght room. Hardly "lazy", and hardly a "quibble". Have you ever seen any "mediot" portray Canseco as "lazy"? Unconcerned with his fielding, yes. Lazy, no.  >>>bad fielder, I think this is still interesting.

Well, Canseco has been involved in several felonies, including his high-speed record, carrying concealed fire-arms, and of course the domestic violence. Clemens had a run-in at a bar. Canseco had that, as well, and in both cases, the coverage was relatively minimal.  >>Puckett? Stewart? Jackson? > >I said "over-represent" non-whites.

The only category that I see which shows an advantage >for Alomar is OBP  Hmmm...what about walks and SB? Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and beat him in SLG by a lesser margin. Even putting aside any other factors, a player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with a 28 point edge in SLG. The issue has been studied before, and I doubt you could come up with any convincing argument the other way. People see the batting average and the HR, but they don't really know their value is worth unless they've studied the issue closely. The fact is that Baerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar; while Baerga was making outs, Alomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter, Winfield et.al.

Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's where OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in. These simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player's offensive contribution to the team's runs scored.  Thank you for making our case. Have a nice day.  Greg

Remember, the Yankees had the best record of any team in the 80's, and probably take the 20's through 60's as well.

I think they are a second-division team. They should finish ahead of the Royals, Mariners, and *possibly* Athletics. But I don't think they'll be above .500. (I think the East is stronger this year.)  Last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible. This year their offense is better, but their pitching is still pretty bad. Even if Finley returns to form, he won't replace what they lost in Abbott. Sanderson? Farrell? I don't believe it.  And while their BA may be good, and they have decent speed, their offense lacks punch. They don't have any bona fide power hitters. (Salmon, Snow, Davis, and Curtis? None with more than 20 HR potential.)  Cheers, -Valentine  P.S. Which AL team had the most steals last week? Those go-go Tigers! The mediots finally managed to convince them that they needed "more balance" in their lineup. You see, they were scoring too many runs too consistently. Gotta run more to break that up.

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu- tion from the rest of the team's. There is only one way of determin- ing "best" in baseball. And that is by looking at the scoreboard at the end of the game. Each game determines which *team* is the best that day. At the end of the season, the team that was the best the most often is the best in the division. The playoffs determine the best of the best. But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*. Not the individual players. There is no method inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances. And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely that player A's team would have played better with player B in their lineup. Sheer speculation. Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done better with those statistics as a criteria, then fine. But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individual's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only measure of "best" that has any meaning in the context of base- ball. So until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of Clemens is totally sub- jective and is mere opinion. I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.  >The fact is that Morris didn't "win" any ballgames, Toronto did, in >spite of Morris' "contribution". This has been explained to you  Exactly. The Jays won with Morris pitching. And Boston wins with Clemens pitching. I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between players are totally meaningless and that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.  >many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.  You don't have to be rude.  >You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.  For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of my argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi. I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings (although I have, tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past). I am saying that it is impossible to isolate an individual's performance from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.  The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it. There is no new knowledge being produced. So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.  --  cordially, as always, maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca "So many morons... rm ...and so little time."

  Boy, hats off to any Cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put down Braves fans. I mean, all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutive world series. Also, being the Cubs fan that I am, I really have to hand it to all the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that infernal cheer that they have.  However, I do have to protest anyone saying that all Cubs fans are stupid. The way I see it, either I'm just too stupid to acknowledge it, or that observation was just plain wrong. You might have us confused with Bear fans. ;)  Anyway, about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the Cubs would finish up last in their division. (Even behind Florida?!? Sheesh!) These same people were predicting the Braves to clean up in their respective division. Well, we're ten games into the season and these people are a little less vocal now. I wonder why.  Well, the way I see it, the East is up for grabs, and whoever wants it most is going to take it, with the exception of Florida. Every team seems to have good batting and pitching, with Philly presently leading the pack. But, I just have to point out, if the Cubs do take the East, they'll do it without the benefit of a competent manager. However, and it pains me to say it, the pennant is going to go to the West.  Just had to get that off my chest.  Doc  bem benefit of a compee

In terms of PEAK, and I repeat PEAK years, Winfield has Done it all. He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300 while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero, and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows? For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5 million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age of Yankee domination.

  It depends. If, in the judgment of the umpire the batter made no attempt to avoid getting hit, the batter is awarded first for a base on balls. If the umpire rules he did try to get out of the way, he's awarded first because of a hit batsman.  Ryan Robbins Penobscot Hall University of Maine  IO20456@Maine.Maine.Edu

I was at that game, behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the radar gun. The 1991 season was winding down and Roger didn't have his best fastball, topping out at 88-90 (in contrast to Frank Tanana, who went as low as 50 with one lollipop in the process of striking out Phil Plantier *five* times on the night). Inky's shot would have gone further than any I've ever seen if it hadn't crashed *into* the lights (not the lightstand) as you say over 100 feet high, Roy Hobbs-like, and bounced back onto the field.

How long did Viola sign for. Three years? I generally agree with their policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers. But I think they enforce it rather too strictly. These days the premier pitchers all sign three or four year deals. Which leaves the Jays with Morris and Stewart. If the Jays want to compete for top free agent pitchers, they will have to accept greater risks.  Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris? Are there any automatic activation clauses? What is the buyout amount?f  Cheers, -Valentine
   O.K. It would be a shame for Cards fans on the net to go through the 1993 championship season without a mailing list to talk on so I would be willing to look at starting one.  Except there's one little problem...  I don't know the first thing about how to do it or what it requires in terms of resources or time. So if some kind soul could e-mail me the particulars of getting starting and managing a mail list, I'd see if it would be feasible for me to start a Cards mailing list.

  > >Give Jackson a break...he lost about 10 pounds with that flu he had >when he was traded. >  DJ was a popular player in San Diego, Derek Bell was not faring well in the clubhouse at Toronto, so no matter how bad he looks now I still think it was a steal for the Jays just from the perspective of team chemistry. No statistic can describe it (sorry statheads) and since there are so many new faces in the clubhouse I think the Jays are still trying to find it.  (Insert the same comment into the Jack Morris v.

I'm glad to see him faring well for the Padres though.  -- Eric

   Philadelphia at Chicago: Teams tied for 1st after Sunday Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series. One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. "What could be better," declared Ernie Banks. Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging? "It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked," announced Ryne Sandberg. "If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win. "Lord, I hope we pull it off." The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second. Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third. Rose went to second on the play. Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third. Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them. Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year. Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center. "Cool Papa" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring. Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat. "Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total. It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace. The picthers have slumped at times." So came the analysis from Frank Chance. The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run. In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1. Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third. Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit. Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third. Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered. Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter. Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning. The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies. Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday. To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third. Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty. Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs. Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings. The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph. Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts. Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win. Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth. The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done. After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season. Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday. However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2. "We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed," remarked Lou Brock. "I don't see why we can't win this division." The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them. Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. ------------------------------------------------------------------- New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th! "When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this," spoke Gil Hodges before the series. Keith Hernandez added that "their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins." The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers. Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams. Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense. When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark. They had been unable to several times in the past month. Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game. Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates. The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second. With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit. The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter. Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second. He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon. Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning. Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win. The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------ San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire. In fact, reported manager John McGraw, "once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while." Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1. Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits. Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest. The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each. The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record. They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though. Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth. He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh. Joe McGinnity earned the save. In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3. The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. ------------------------------------------------------------------- San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5): Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good. With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better. McGriff's batting average was even rising. Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up. Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3. McGriff launched two home runs. Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score. Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing. The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth. Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning. Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around. Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win. The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds. Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5): Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome. The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale. "Normally," Drysdale remarked, "I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them. I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't afford to let the Astros beat us." He then winked and said: "Well, maybe Davis will get decked once." The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season. The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples. Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers. For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs. The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet. "It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs'," remarked Roy Campanella. The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager. After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch. He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning. They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4. They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game. "I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop," he explained. "How can we do that," Pee Wee Reese wondered. "They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run. Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws. We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time." The plan almost worked. Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third. 3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save. The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win. Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough. "We're mostly a power team," remarked Ron Cey. "Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then. We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome. I guess that's why they're so successful there." Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome. The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

Strictly from memory, I think the Phillies were something like ten games up with 12 to go, lost 10 in a row, and 11 of last 12 to lose to the Cardinals. Seems impossible, but thats how I remember it.

Actually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem. It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of bell curve. (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting vs. non-clutch; the Y-axis being the number of players.) Certainly there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell. My *supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently (year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players (as opposed to all baseball players).

Before you accuse me of >completely cooking the data,  You won't hear those kind of accusations from me. It is interesting that you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also looked at. He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA), hitting in 1989 - 92 .217, .273, .250, .272 Admittedly, he has been traded between leagues as well as clubs. His clutch hitting record is equally inconsistent. So, for my purposes in 1993 I would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior performance. I don't know how I would have felt in 1988, but you may indeed be right.  When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his non-clutch BA. Ditto for Joe Carter.  This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having with others on this topic. Must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity? Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?   >BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with >'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at >something better than the 99.9% confidence level.

You *cannot* allow a team to come out at the ump as the Braves did. I usually rip umps, but in this case, the players were dead wrong. Cox should go for 5 games. If I had ever umped a game where that happened, I'd have ejected every player that came out. Only Cox and Gant would have been spared, and then Cox would have gone in the ensuing argument.  --dave

Or something or other. I don't pretend to understand >statistical analysis. >  Well, we agree on the last part.:-) One of the basic things you need to have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year. A player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year. A player's ability to walk or infielder's Defensive Average are correlated better. That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics we can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year. Put in some simple information about aging and you can do even better. One of the basic problems with something like "clutch" batting average - overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. Adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much. As a counterexample to what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:  Non-Clutch Clutch AB H BA AB H BA  Maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78 .307 Lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223  If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those "clutch" situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye. Well, in 1988, Maldonado hit .267 in "non-clutch" and .190 in "clutch", while Lemon hit .254 in "non-clutch" and .313 in "clutch". Before you accuse me of completely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ "clutch" at bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias). As a simple measure of clutchness, let's just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use '84-'87 to predict '88 for those 96 players, you'd find that 27 of the 96 were below league average in that measure both in '84-87 and in '88, 26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were above in one and below in the other. If you were just flipping coins, you'd expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched. The difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment is not statisically significant.  BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with '88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at something better than the 99.9% confidence level. Correlating their (clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of 0.088, significant at no level of any interest.  > > >> Everyone would agree (I hope) that a grand >> slam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three >> is a VERY clutch hit.

Owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches. He will have a fine fielding percentage, like always. The problem is that he doesn't reach anything that isn't hit straight at him!  This wouldn't be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to Kelly Gruber or Robin Ventura. But the third baseman for the Yankees is Wade Boggs (who should have moved across the diamond *last* year)!  I've only seen one game, Abbott's first start, but there were three balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality defensive players. Instead they were charged as hits against Abbott.  Cheers, -Valentine

  Like Clinton and Reno, I accept full responsibility for this senseless disaster. My wife and I picked this game to go to and thus caused the return of the pre-season-projected Sox offense. Like all no-no's Bosio was good, lucky (hard grounder by Vaughn off T. Martinez' glove but straight to Boone who threw to Bosio at first, 3-4-1), and backed by good defense (many non-trivial groundouts). The game was amazingly fast, as the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also working fast. The Sox relief pitching was ok -- the runs off Quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single which Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch.  Greenwell's mental stability is a serious concern (I guess it has always been, but his quirks were amusing back when he was an MVP candidate). Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a after striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently Johnson made an "ok, I've got to stay focused" gesture which Iron Mike interpreted as taunting), and struck out to heavy booing the next two times. As Valentine noted, last night he came up in the first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game. Can you say "take the first pitch"? Not Mike, who dribbled it into a 6-4-3. The PI quoted Bosio that this was a "batting practice fastball". Next time up he also hit the first pitch, a hard liner straight to KGJr in center. He also made the pathetic error and failed to catch Boone's HR (which looked comparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlight reel that night).  Is Riles suppsoed to be good defensively? I couldn't tell from the field angle but his range looked bad, and he coughed a DP that cost a run or two. Why was he leadoff? I hope Fletcher gets well soon.  Also on lineups, Pinella put Bret Boone fifth for reasons beyond me. It seemed to work, as he was 3-4 with a HR and some good defense (a wag behind us said "He sure don't want to go back to Calgary!") There is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth because they'll likely lead off the second (as Boone did).  Well, now we face the hot Angels and another power pitcher in Langston. A reminder that contest entries are open through next Wednesday -- I expect a surge of pessimism. By the way, ties will be broken by earliest entry. One entry per person or pseudonym, please, and easy on the pseudonyms.  Dave MB

Henderson is the best leadoff hitter of all-time, arguably. Winfield has meant more to his team than Henderson. Unlike daryll, henderson tries hard. He is an amazing centerfielder. Rickey is VERY good, maybe better than winfield, I was angry at the dissing of winfield. Though Winfield has been better than henderson lately. Check the numbers, winfield may surprise you. He will have 3000 basehits, and should have 500 homeruns when he retires(wishful thiniking if he plays to 45)

  Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate, with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times. My opinion, FWIW, to all:  Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his "prime" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

Part of that may be his mobility. 1988 was with the Yankees. 1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield. 1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  >Williams, Matt ---- ---- .633 .653 .656 0.647 Add another to the elite fielders list.  >Caminiti, Ken ---- .675 .630 .653 .596 0.642 >Sabo, Chris .751 .626 .616 .613 .575 0.642 Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.

  Note: I'm not posting this as part of an argument with Roger Meynard, but as an independent sort of thread. I do actually quote some things that Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as "sampling" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what I want to say.  maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (Roger Maynard) writes: >But the point is that the only decision making pro- >cess used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re- >lates to the *teams*. Not the individual players. There is no method >inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances. And that >is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  There's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people's conception of a biological organism. In the biology context, we would very likely read "fitness" for "the score of the game" and "organisms" for "teams". How we interpret "players" is trickier, but either "organs", or "genes" might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make. A "genes" interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, but that would be a different and probably longer post.  If, however, we take the "organ" view, then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like "species X is more fit than species Y because of a better organ Z". Given what we know about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious of such claims. (But note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map "species X" onto 'humans', and "organ Z" onto 'brain'). On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain' above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross pathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).  Even when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another. (Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species.) However, if we are non-vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable "whole" but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable. Some of these processes might be localized to particular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple organs. In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.  >To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- >solutely that player A's team would have played better with player B >in their lineup. Sheer speculation. Impossible to ascertain.  One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do. But, of course, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty. Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation, but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.  >If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens >has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a >criteria, then fine.  In this cases, we're seeing the word "statistics" means "summary of observed events", where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes. Thus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses.  >But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the >individual's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only >measure of "best" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.  This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again. Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment; you might be fit in one situation and not another. Moving to baseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league. In at least a nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the league, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts. But in a real sense, there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball. The same is true in biology. But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the World Series in basebal. In the world series, the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played, and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful. It might be fun to watch, but it's unclear what it all really means.  ***  Now just one more un-related point:  >I have yet to see that any of you can predict a >WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.  On the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis. But this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference between the winners and the losers.  Moreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World Series situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict the WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.  >The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it. There is no new >knowledge being produced.  Since stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know the events you can derive the stats. But if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new knowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and useful. Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge in a different field. That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge even though I'm relying on stats to do it.  jking

Well, I don't want shorter games *per se*, but I would like for them to stop *wasting* so much time during games. The Gant incident is a perfect example.

  Just curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the BB DDD this year. I expect the Phillies staff, while getting the wins, would have to rank up there. Luis Gonzalez and Derrick May are among the early league leaders, and all 6 of their bombs have come at the Phils' expense. Neither of them have exactly been know for their tater prowess in the past.  How have the Rockies been early? I know Mile High has produced a ton of runs, but is it the launching pad everyone expected yet?  A concerned fan of the BB DDD,  Adam "Witness to the Phillies lone loss of the season so far" Levin

He must, and I mean MUST, get fastballs to hit...otherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise. What I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds, Williams, and Clark 3-4-5, the reason being that I feel Bonds' potential basestealing abilities are wasted when he's stuck behind two slow runners. I think the chance of getting 20-30 extra stolen bases with Bonds in the 3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having Clark in the 5 spot.  Matt

The runner can leave his base at any time. If the ball is caught, he's got to tag up. If it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up at all. So, if he's feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up. If it isn't caught, he's probably scored a run. If it is, he's probably headed for AAA.  The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out, thereby removing the force on the runners on base. All other rules apply, as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up.  -- Tim Shippert shippert@cco.caltech.edu "If we are going to stick to this damned quantum-jumping, then I regret that I ever had anything to do with quantum theory." -E.

[detailed explanation deleted..]   Indeed, you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement. To rebut my opinion, you have made an analogy with a game of chance. Your hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact on the selection of the numbers, and hence their ability to win.  Well, that's certainly true in Lotto. But it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the sport of baseball. When you start down the wrong path, you finish down the wrong path.      I repeat. I do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting performance.  I do, however, think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance may, for some players, indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance. And I think Chris Sabo is such a player.     -- The Beastmaster  -- Mark Singer mss@netcom.com

But the pitcher is 80% of the defense. The primary role of every other player is on offense. Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive game than of the defensive game. (They might not do much with their part of the offense, but that's another issue.)  That being said, I think both Smith and Yount deserve the HOF. They hit pretty well in addition to their defense.

It would have been the Toronto Blue Jays.  How is that possible? He was on the Albuquerque Leftturns last year. How could you possibly know what team he would be on if Manny Lee was on his team last year. After all, Manny Lee wasn't on his team last year, so it's complete, unfounded speculation to state that if he was on the same team as Manny Lee last year, it would have been the team of the Toronto Blue Jays. Since he and Lee weren't on the same team, you cannot possibly objectively state what team they would have been on if they had both been on the same team.  Greg
  The original poster wanted to know how the Big Cat looked. I was also at the Saturday game in Montreal (Apr 17) that Rockies won 9-1. I haven't paid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance seemed to be MUCH different. He stands more erect and very open, with his left foot pointing to 3rd base. I'm wondering if this is a recent change in stance for him? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. He could always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. If this is indeed a new stance for him, maybe he is not being fooled as easily? As for his patience,  Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. If he was grooving pitches to Andres, you can hardly fault him for drilling them (which he did!). Does Andres generally start hot or cold? Does it take until May for most pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away?  Roger Healey

The argument was  1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game. 2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.  3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12% of defense and pitching is 88% of defense. 4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.  Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and pitching.  >One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the >split probably somewhere around 49.5% and 0.5%.  I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or even 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot more than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often.

So what will happen when the tv contract runs out, considering networks have been losing money on it?

  Pitchers are required to pitch (or feint or attempt a pick-off) within 20 seconds after receiving the ball, not 15.  Pitchers are required to pitch their warm-up throws within a one minute time frame, beginning after each half inning ends, not two minutes.  And the reason why a reliever should be allowed warm-ups is simple: Different mound, different catcher.  Ryan Robbins Penobscot Hall University of Maine  IO20456@Maine.Maine.Edu

   Oh, yea, and Chris Bosio pitched a NO-HITTER. One over the minimum, two bases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, 95 pitches. I listened to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a real treat (as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite, I doubt if anyone is better than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me).  But, I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching, it would have been a different story :-)  Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in Major League baseball .... Pretty impressive in any league.  Man, if Johnson, Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a really interesting team to follow this year. Also, John Cummings (rookie) has had three solid outings with no support. If Fleming comes back this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year (relief is another story, though - grimace).  Too cool. The first no-hitter that I have been able to follow from start to end. And again, I think Niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the game. The guy is truly a joy to listen to -- he deserves a pennant race ...  Kent Dietz Twins in '93 Mariners --- If only they were an NL team! Follow?

Phil Plantier >9. Darren Daulton  Daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange. He's a little bit quiet at the plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level plane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn't think *anyone* could hit like that. Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes contact, it's *solid*. He's got good power to all fields and rarely is he caught not ready for a pitch.  I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to practice his swing while 'on the throne'? :-) Sure looks like it :-)  How 'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front foot and seems to swing *across* his body. He generates a lot of power, but I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot out of his hips.  >Gary's list of "I'd give Dave Kirsch's kidneys to have a swing like that."  Well, they're already spoken for (by several people), but ..  I'd add Robbie Alomar's name to the list, among others.

That guy is a serious ox.  A thought about May: It looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball. IMHO, he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling off the ball to the point that he's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders low and away. Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left and left-center, IMHO you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to the right side of the infield in the next month.  -- Dave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch Blue Jays - Do it again in '93 kirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu New .. quotes out of context!

Well, my question still hasn't been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to release this year, why did he get so much playing time last year? Yes, I know he was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than Slaught, but that doesn't answer the question. If Slaught was so obviously better this year, wasn't this also obvious last year, and shouldn't he have been taking away some of Spanky's playing time against righties?  Greg

I think he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't signed. Anyhow, the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once; it lead to a week-long walkout. Methinks Horner had no work ethic before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped.

  I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would help so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the offseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent although I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This may be Ben's year. I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need. Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs? You never know.

  the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a large enough portion of the population, and have suggested various "remedies", such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that "smoke'embake'emdominatebysheerintimidation" is an accurate description of what is, essentially, a laid-back game.  forget those lame ideas. here is my new and exciting two-point plan to generate interest in baseball among the masses.  point one: sex. point two: violence.  let's face it, sex and violence are the only things that sell in america. here's how we can implement them in the game:  sex: cheerleaders, cheerleaders, and more cheerleaders. dancing on top of the dugouts. bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh inning stretch. running up and down the stands. (the south bend white sox actually do this).  violence: baseball players are such utter wuss boys. the pitcher beans the batter, and both benches empty in what is called a "bench-clearing brawl". EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER. stand, stand, stand. look, look, look. ho, hum. then, the bullpens come running in. when they reach the "fight", they just stand there, too.  anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch should be suspended and fined. further, the bullpens should fight it out in the outfield, so as not to waste time and energy running to the infield.  football: sex, violence. basketball: sex, violence. hockey: violence. baseball: "da pastime of da nayshun!" - yawn.  bob vesterman. 
   As the heading indicates, it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not batting 4th for the Giants behind Will Clark. Barry is such an awesome and consistent hitter -- definitely the best in the National League. IMHO, to have Williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting 4th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the Giants.

  Did anyone notice the words "NOT FOR BASEBALL" printed on the picture of Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA Today? Any reason given for this?  Also, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in the preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout. On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are both great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing and more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts.  Kevin
  Today, Frank Viola and rest of pitcher staff of Boston Red Sox shutout Chicago White Sox 4-0. It is Red Sox 9th win of this season.  So far, Red Sox won all the games Roger and Frank V. pitched (6-0) and 3-3 when other three starters were pitching. Tomorrow, Dopson will pitch again (have a good first start and rocky second start). I wonder that Bosox can play over 500 ball without Roger and Frank V.

I was there to see them face Baltimore and couldn't help but listen to the Boston fans talk about various players on the team. One guy was totally obliterating Boggs, how he sucks, etc.... I told him I was a Yankee fan and I'd take him in a second and who would he want in a trade back. He said a pile of sh*t. I know Boggs had some personal problems while playing for Boston, but come on he's a future hall of famer who really adds a needed dimension to the Yanks. A solid hitter, a decent fielder and more importantly a teacher, ask Pat Kelly. I think he's got a few good years left in his bat and may be a key contributor down the stretch as they win the American League East this year. Boston fans have no class!!!

I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated. It appears that in a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two home runs). Or do they? What is "equivalent average?"  One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took away some homers. Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway. But Bo, despite his speed, hit very few doubles and not that many triples. So I would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  > That is good. Very good, in fact.

Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park. I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player. Maybe .330/.550 . Not even close.  > He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his > baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting. > That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The > media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a > good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best > hitter in the majors.  I'd put him about there too.  Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much. I thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so at baseball. He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't winning.  Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group) with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).  We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well. Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction; the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent the player has left college ball, etc.  Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of "error." Sometimes a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star. Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe McDowell, Mickey Brantley). This error involves real things: there are real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did. It may (who knows) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on.  But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well. One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players. One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing ball. Their backgrounds are similar.  What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background? Is there some reason to believe that a Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly?  It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players. (It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after all, an art). I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton. "Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers," they say. Well, what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean? It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than Tuscon. It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in Atlanta than Greenville.  Then again, it might not. Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor MLE's. But you guys DON'T KNOW. What's worse, you don't know that you don't. And you don't know that there are other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties again. You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal. It's not. It's got some error.  Oh well.  Bill Guilford  still thinks "hairy butt is truly ugly" might be right

Perhaps so. I was only responding to the "Yankees of the 20's and 30's" part of the comment.

  Is there any doubt that this is true? After a few down years, the A.L. East is back to where it was in the early eighties. With the emergence of the O's and the Yanks, it is far and away the best. While the N.L. West has the best team in baseball, and the Reds aren't bad either, they have nothing else. The Giants, Astros, and Padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounf teams that are found in the A.L. East. And the Dodgers just plain suck. As for the Rockies, who knows? The A.L. East has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot to free agency, Toronto is still one of the best in baseball. The Orioles have the preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina, and you can never forget about Ripken. The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don't hurt to much either, although I always liked Bill Ripken. While they let a lot go this summer (Randy Milligan, Joe Orsulak, Bill Ripken, Bob Milacki, Sam Horn, Storm Davis, and Craig Lefferts), they kept the heart of their team intact.  My predicted finish: 1. Baltimore (Could be a biased opinion) 2. NY Yankees 3. Toronto 4. Milwaukee 5. Detroit 6. Boston 7. Cleveland (Would have been higher if not for the accident)  Go O's!!!!!!!! --
  Is it just me, or does Bichette look totally lost in the outfield? He misplayed Martinez fly-out into a double against the Expos, misplayed Alou's single into a triple (Alou tagged out at 3rd after over-sliding the bag) and now he misplays another out into a 3 run triple...add in his wonderful batting average and we have one heck of a player!  Don Boell 
  Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart. Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat shaky) innings giving up just one run. Then game the dreaded relief. Three picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning and blew the save opportunity. (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).  Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont be taken lightly. Going into today's game, the had the league's leading hitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young and Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The event that had the most impact on Gaetti's career was his leg injury in 1988. His performance dropped radically from 1988 to 1989.

If you believe in clutch hitting, then look at how the guy hit with RISP. If you want to see how good of a slugger he is, then look at his slugging average.  In terms of evaluating players, RBI totals are better than nothing.

I explained that I know that it is essential for some fans to get scores here, for they cannot get them elsewhere. I have no problem with what you do, posting scores AFTER the games have been completed. However, like I said earlier, I don't think it is a necessity to post scores during the middle of games, like some others have come to practice.  - Sean
  Well, it really isn't this cut and dry, but as a Jay fan the thing I feared worst has happened. The Yanks sent down Williams G and are going to start Williams B in CF. I also believe they kept Wickman and Millitello in their rotation, which is much nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they'd throw out their to the slaughterhouse because of their "experience". Granted, Witt "might" be good, but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters up and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has experience. The Yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; the Jays with the loss of Dave Stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their pitching staff. The Orioles should also be there in the end.....  Gord Niguma (to salvage the season, let JJ Olerud win MVP)

What a shame about > Charlie Hayes, huh?  Actually, according to the DA information posted by Sherri, Boggs is superior defensively to have. Here's their Defensive Averages for the last five years: [compared to average at 3b, AL]  1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 Boggs .643[+2] .659[+47] .550[-54] .653[+33] .634[+32] Hayes ------- .601[-40] .622[+18] .606[-14] .574[-28]  If Hayes is a defensive standout at third, he's done a good job in disguising it. To put it another way, compared to an average third baseman last year:  Boggs converted 11 more grounders into outs, turned 2 more double plays, and prevented 11 doubles.  Hayes let 12 more grounders go by for hits, turned 6 more double plays, and prevented 4 doubles. -- Dale J.

   Some time back in this newsgroup, I seem to recall a thread about predicting the runs a given lineup of 9 batters could be expected to score given the appropriate statistical alphabet soup for these hitters (OBP, SLG, AVG, bat length, hat size, day-of-the-week, weather conditions, etc.). :-) Anyway, was I dreaming or is there some such animal?  My apologies if this has been covered recently, I probably get to read 10% of the articles posted here. No time.

I don't think Valentine ever said Boston will win this year. Boy, talk about sensitive, insecure Toronto fans. :)  In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing. Why? Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does Toronto have?    -Mike /mike@columbia.edu

And thus, we come to one of the true beauties of baseball; these things, along with many others will never be separated. Almost *everything* in baseball is situational and interdependent. This is what allows us to carry on all the arguments that we have. If everything could be explained and balanced on a statistical basis, none of the wonder and mystery would be left. Why we might have to resort to just going out the ballyard and enjoy the game itself.  --->Paul, feeling a little anti-stathead today -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We will stretch no farm animal beyond its natural length  paula@koufax.cv.hp.com Paul Andresen Hewlett-Packard (503)-750-3511  home: 3006 NW McKinley Corvallis, OR 97330 (503)-752-8424 A SABR member since 1979
